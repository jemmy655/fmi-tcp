NAME
       fmu-master - simulate FMUs

SYNOPSIS
       fmu-master [ -hlqrvcdfmopst ] [ files ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       fmu-master simulates FMUs using the FMILibrary from JModelica.org

FLAGS
       -h     Show help and quit.

       -l     Show FMILibrary logs.

       -q     Quiet mode, do not print simulation info to STDOUT. This flag should be used together with -r.

       -r     Real time mode. Will usleep() in between communication steps if the execution was faster than real time.

       -v     Show version and quit.

       -x     Print XML and quit.

OPTIONS
       -c [CONNECTIONS]
              Connection specification. No connections by default. Quadruples of positive integers, representing which FMU and value reference to connect from and what to connect to. Syntax is

                  CONN1:CONN2:CONN3...

              where  CONNX  is four comma-separated integers; FMUFROM,VRFROM,FMUTO,VRTO.  An example connection string is 0,0,1,0:0,1,1,1 which means: connect FMU0 (value reference 0) to FMU1 (vr 0) and FMU0 (vr 1) to FMU1 (vr 1).  Default is no connec‚Äê
              tions.

       -d [TIMESTEP]
              Timestep size. Default is 0.1.

       -f [OUTFORMAT]
              Outout file format. Currently only "csv" is supported, and it is also the default.

       -m [METHOD]
              Stepping method. Currently only "jacobi" is supported, and it is also the default.

       -o [OUTFILE]
              Result output file. If set to "stdout", then output will be to STDOUT. Default value is "result.csv".

       -p [PARAMS]
              Parameter specification. Triplets separated by :, specifying FMU index, value reference index and parameter value. Example setting the three first value references of FMU 0: "0,0,12.3:0,1,true:0,2,9". Default is no parameters.

       -s [SEPARATOR]
              CSV separator character. Default is comma (,).

       -t [ENDTIME]
              End simulation time in seconds. Default is 1.0.

EXAMPLES
       To run an FMU simulation from time 0 to 5 with timestep 0.01:
           fmu-master -t 5 -d 0.01 ../myFMU.fmu

       To simulate two FMUs connected from the first output of the first FMU to the first input of the second:
           fmu-master -c 0,0,1,0 a.fmu b.fmu

       To simulate quietly (without output to STDOUT) and save the results to file:
           fmu-master -q -o out.csv a.fmu

       The app was built by Stefan Hedman at UMIT Research Lab 2013.
